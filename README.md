# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: README
**By:** coffeeandchocolate

## How It Works
There is only one script in this project:
* run_analysis.R

Running this script will download the zip file that contains the data
for this project, unzip it, and complete all the steps of the assignment

## Assumptions
1. Your R working directory is already set to the folder where you want the data to be downloaded
