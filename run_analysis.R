# STEP 1
# Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.


# STEP 2
# Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 


# STEP 3
# Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set


# STEP 4
# Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 


# STEP 5
# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the 
# average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
